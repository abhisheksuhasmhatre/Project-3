two libraries taken - https://build.particle.io/build/57f5828b36e51f2d0700097d/lib/57564201d100a7f0f6000952/tab/a-rainbow.cpp

first library is for neopixel. it was used in the code to light up the pixel as per requirements.
second library is for OLED. it is used to code the OLED in way where i can display the incoming data from the cloud.

i have made a boat with using a 3D printer and laser cutter.
i have made the base of photon and two front sensors using 3D printers.
i have made the body of the ship using laser printer.
i have added

i have used two proximity sensors. each sensor will give a output in the form of voltages.
i have taken that voltages to determine if any obstales in the front or at the back.
i have used OLED and neopixel to see the reading from the sensors and the counter, which i am using to check the voltage of obstacles.
